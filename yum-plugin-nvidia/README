A yum plugin to prevent install or update of NVIDIA drivers on unsupported hardware.

NVIDIA occasionally drops support for older hardware from the current driver release.
This plugin prevents nvidia drivers being updated on hardware that is no longer supported.

At present yum-plugin-nvidia only works with kmod-nvidia packages >= 352.21-3

Bugs should be reported at http://elrepo.org/bugs
